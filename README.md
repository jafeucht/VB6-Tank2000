Title: Tank 1999!!!
Description: THIS is code you've got to see. I won the Code-Of-The-Month award for a game I submitted in August, the previous version of this. Several comments pressured me to develop it more. This is new and improved, new graphics + sounds, features, and more!!! I would have submitted this code about three months ago, but the sound files made it too large, and there would be a big unhandled error if they were missing. I fixed that, and now you can enjoy it without sound.
